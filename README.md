## Description

### Purpose: 
This website serves as a portfolio for potential employers or clients (the target audience) to see my work and capabilities. There isn't much to show yet so the content is almost entirely placeholders. In the future, completed projects, and other professional achievements will be presented on this site. 

### Layout and Functionality: 
[Wireframe Link](./docs/Design.png)

The website has a mobile-first design and uses a very simple and clean design to keep a clear focus on the main content. 

Throughout the site semantic HTML elements have been used to increase accessibility of the site. Most commonly, the semantic tag is used to separate each component throughout the site to clearly define the boundaries of each piece of content.

The homepage contains three visual components that communicate to the user the purpose of the website and what to expect when navigating it. These contain a related image and serve as links to other pages of the site. 

The navigation bar contains the same links as the home page but are shown on each page of the site. This keeps the focus of the site in view of the user and allows quick access to each page of the site for easy navigation. 

The footer of each page is the same and contains a simple layout of essential contact information (phone number, email address, link to LinkedIn (not actually linked to my profile but will be in the future)).

### Sitemap
[View Sitemap](./docs/sitemap-portfolio.jpg)

The sitemap demonstrates the simple map of the website. The Home page is the Root of the website. Each of the other pages (About, Resume, Blog) are all children of Home. 

There are two links to external websites (GitHub from Resume, and LinkedIn from the footer of each page). There is also a link to a PDF that will open on a new page (also linked from Resume page).
